Problem:
144 horses.
Only 12 horses can race at once (because there are 12 tracks).
No stopwatch is allowed; you can only see the order in which horses finish.
You must find the fastest 11 horses.

Question: What is the minimum number of races required? Explain the reasoning step-by-step.

Step-by-Step Solution:
Step 1: Race all horses in groups

Divide 144 horses into 12 groups, each group with 12 horses.
Conduct 12 races, one for each group.
After these races, you know the order of horses within each group (1st to 12th), but you cannot compare horses across different groups.

At this point:
12 races have been used.
You know the top 12 horses of each group individually, but no direct comparison between groups.

Step 2: Race all the winners of each group
Now, take the winners (the horses who came first in each group).
Conduct a race among these 12 winners.
This race determines the fastest horse overall.

At this point:
1 more race is conducted (total races so far = 13).
The winner of this race is the fastest horse among all 144.

Step 3: Identify potential candidates for 2nd to 11th place
The fastest horse is already found.
To find the next 10 fastest horses, you only need to consider certain horses:
Horses that came 2nd and 3rd in the winners' race.
Horses that came 2nd and 3rd in the same group as the fastest horse.
Horses that came 2nd and 3rd in the group of the 2nd place horse from the winners' race.
Horses that came 2nd and 3rd in the group of the 3rd place horse from the winners' race.
You do not need to consider horses ranked below 3rd in their own groups, because they are slower than the top 3 of their groups and therefore cannot be among the overall top 11.

Step 4: Conduct another race among the selected candidates
Collect all the potential candidates (about 10 to 15 horses).
Conduct one more race among these selected horses.

From the result:
Identify the horses ranked 2nd to 11th overall.
Combine them with the fastest horse already found.

Calculation of Total Races:
Action	Number of Races
Race 144 horses in 12 groups	12
Race among winners (12 horses)	1
Race among candidates for 2nd to 11th	1
Total	14 races minimum

Important Assumptions:
No two horses tie in any race.
Horses' performance is consistent (no randomness).
Track conditions are identical for all races.

Potential Pitfalls:
If horses perform inconsistently across races, the strategy may fail.
If there is a tie and no clear order, extra races may be required.
If track conditions differ across races, results can be misleading.

Final Answer:
Minimum 14 races are needed to guarantee finding the 11 fastest horses.
